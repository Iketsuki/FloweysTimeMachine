    <h3>Using external tool</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to temporarily try out a save, you can use the third party
      tool
      <a href="https://github.com/LEGOlord208/UndertaleSandbox" target="_blank"
        >UndertaleSandbox</a
      >. Please note that we are in <b>no way</b> related to them, or any of
      their actions. If you wish to learn the manual way of installing, carry on
      with the tutorial!
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
      First, you need to find your Undertale save folder. This is usually
      <code>C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/UNDERTALE</code>, but it might be
      different for you, who knows. It should contain at least a file called
      <code>undertale.ini</code> and a file called <code>file0</code>, unless
      you haven't saved your game yet, or the save was deleted.
    </p>
    <h3>Loading</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have found where your existing save data is, you can load it into
      Flowey's Time Machine to edit it. You don't have to load an existing save
      though you can select a preset instead at the top, or use the default
      preset which is set by default.
    </p>
    <h3>Editing</h3>
    <p>
      Just edit the various fields to your liking. Some fields can be hovered over
      with the mouse to get some information about the field.
    </p>
    <h3>Saving</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have edited the data to your liking, you can save it using the
      save button. Just overwrite your existing file0 and undertale.ini.
    </p>
    <h3>Undoing genocide erased world / selling your soul</h3>
    <p>
      If you erased your world, you should see a file called
      <code>system_information_962</code>. <br />If you sold your soul, you
      should also see a file called <code>system_information_963</code>.
      <br />Just delete these files using your file manager. If you are using
      the Steam version of the game, these files might be backed up and restored
      by the game on startup. In that case, you should delete the Steam data for
      UNDERTALE in addition to the system_ files. You can do this in multiple ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Modify the file permissions so that Steam cannot detect the file.<br />
        If you replace the file with a folder of the same name and restrict Steam's
        permissions to it, neither the game nor Steam will detect the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Disconnect the game from Steam.<br />
        By renaming or deleting <code>steam_api.dll</code> in Undertale's game folder
        (NOT the save folder; it's where the game executable runs from, usually
        <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale</code>), the
        game will be disconnected from Steam. Deleting the system_ files will then work
        normally, but you won't be able to launch the game through Steam.
      </li>
    </ul>
